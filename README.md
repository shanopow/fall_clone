# Intro
This is a weird project, essentially a clone of fallout 1 but just stripped to its absolute core fatures, along with being implemented thorugh basic terminal, without any real GUI.

Implemented in python, with some json for storage and only a few non-standard dependencies.

# To-Do
A few little tasks I want to implement still.
1. Add stitching different maps together so we can use preset templates to stitch together. (Low priority)
2. Add quests
3. Add combat
4. Add enemies and assosiated systems (Highest Priority)
5. Simply write more maps (Need to do eventually)
