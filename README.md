# Intro
This is a weird project, essentially a clone of fallout 1 but just stripped to its absolute core features, along with being implemented thorugh basic terminal, without any real GUI.
Made just to see how to manage a large clump of different files and systems stuck together.

Implemented in python, with some json for storage and only a few non-standard dependencies. (e.g. getch, colorama).
All imports needed listed in main.py.

# To-Do
A few little tasks I want to implement still.
1. Add stitching different maps together so we can use preset templates to stitch together. (Low priority)
2. Add quests
3. Add combat (Dependant on Enemies)
4. Add enemies and associated systems (Highest Priority)
5. Simply write more maps (Need to do eventually)

# Note
This task has been made into two branches.
Main is the normal project.
The second branch is to test procedurally generating zones using some preset maps and then randomly populating with enemies, traps, loot etc.
This is like a dungeon crawler system.
Might be merged, maybe not.
