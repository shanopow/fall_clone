# Intro
This is a weird project, essentially a clone of fallout 1 but just stripped to its absolute core features, along with being implemented thorugh basic terminal, without any real GUI.
Made just to see how to manage a large clump of different files and systems stuck together.

Implemented in python, with some json for storage and only a few non-standard dependencies. (e.g. getch, colorama).
All imports listed in requirements.txt.

# To-Do
A few little tasks I want to implement still.
1. Add stitching different maps together so we can use preset templates to stitch together. (Low priority)
2. Add quests
3. Add combat (Dependant on Enemies)
4. Add enemies and associated systems (Highest Priority)
5. Simply write more maps (Need to do eventually)
6. Add weapons, armour (Just tedious)

# Note
Direction on this is currently undecided.
Might go towards procedurally generated or towards hardcoded, maybe both
When this is resolved this message will no longer be here
